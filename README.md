A comfy way to manage your config files

At present, this is just a place for me to store my scripts for managing my
configs (not very comfy yet.) Ultimately, I want to turn this into a more robust
tool for managing config files (very comfy.)

For now, I'm just writing quick and dirty bash scripts to A) get the job done,
and B) flesh out the workflow for it. Once I've got a system pretty well in
place, I'll rewrite it in JavaScript and polish it up for public consumption.

__Until then, I don't advise using this.__ It's a very rough prototype, and I'm not
handling edge cases yet.
